Serve-Smart App â€“ Documentation
1. Overview

The Serve-Smart App is a kiosk-style application built with React (frontend) and a Node.js/Express (backend), connected via REST API. It allows users to browse menu items, add them to cart, and make payments. The backend uses JSON Server / Express API for mock data and can later be connected to a database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.).

2. Features

Menu Management: Fetch menu items from backend API.

Search & Browse: Users can search and filter menu items.

Cart System: Add, update, and remove items.

Payment Flow: Mock payment integration with "Pay Now" button.
